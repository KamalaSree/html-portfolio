<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Kamala and I am a very passionate web developer. I love creating unique websites using AI, AR, MERN stack, etc. I love to mantain a clean design when it comes to designing websites. 
</p>

<p>Currently I am learning Web development through Angela Yu's course on Udemy. I am also good at Data Structures and Algorithms
  One of my favourite Data structures is Stack. Although the operations of Stack are pretty simple, it is used in various applications. 
</p>

<p>Apart from this, I am also planning to build a few projects such as an AI chatbot (By finetuning), Real time collaborative Checklist with emoji reactions,
  Badminton score prediction, A Lofi website where there are features like Pomodoro clock, Sticky notes, Gratitude Journal and a To do list, 4-7-8 Breathing exercise option to relieve any stress.
  I am so excited to start my journey as a developer. I want to build projects that can showcase my skills really well.
